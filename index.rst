Symfony2 is highly customisable and provides a number of different ways to
perform the same task. Some examples of this include writing configuration
options in YAML, XML, PHP, or Annotation, and creating templates using Twig or
PHP. To keep this tutorial simple we will use YAML and Annotations for
configuration and Twig for templating. The
`Symfony book <http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/index.html>`_
provides a great resource for examples of how to use the other methods.
If other people would like to contribute to the completion of alternative methods

and send over the pull requests :)
